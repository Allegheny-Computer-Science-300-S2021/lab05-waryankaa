#### Part 1.


 1. Which software did you use to conduct your analysis?

 In order to conduct my analysis, I used the the online interactive demo provided in the lab.

 2. How similar were the two sequences (`s1.fasta` and `s2.fasta`) which you applied an alignment program?

 After applying the alignment program, the two sequences are very similar. Of the 20 nucleotides given 12 were the same across both sequences.


 3. Are the two sequences closely related to each other, in your opinion?

 In my opinion, the two sequences were closely related.


 4. What proof do you have to suggest such a claim?

I'd suggest that the two sequences were closely related because over half of the nucleotides are the same. If they were not similar, then they would have more different sequences. While they are not the same, they most likely had a close common ancestor.

```
A	T	T	T	G	G	C	T	A	C	A	T	T	T	C	A	C	A	G	T	-
A	T	T	T	C	A	C	A	G	T	A	T	T	-	C	A	C	T	G	A	G
Score = 1
```

#### Part 2
 1. How much similarity exists between each of the sequences to the others?

There is a lot of similarities between the sequences. The lease similar is between the 05 sequence and the 06 sequence and these two sequences were 95.2% similar. The most similar occurred between the 06 strand and the 07 strand, and these were 97.5% similar. Even between the 05 strand and the 07 strand where there was a two year difference was 96.0 % similar.


 2. Based on your results so far (which are too few to provide a comprehensive study), do you believe there is evidence that human adaptation is occurring in H5N1 viruses that might merit concern about human-to-human transmission in the near future?

Based on the evidence I do not believe there is enough change to merit concern about human-to-human transmission in the near future. Even the most dissimilar was less than 5% dissimilar. Also the 05 virus was more similar to the 07 virus than the 06. This could indicate that the virus changes between slightly different mutations. Now there could be a chance that the 5% difference is significant enough to cause the different year virus to act different which would merit concern.

 3. Statistics: What were the numbers of Lengths, Similarities, Gaps and Scores for each of your alignment tasks?

 05 vs 06:
 Lengths: 1776
 Similarities: 1690/1776
 Gaps: 45/1776
 Scores: 8286.0

 05 vs 07:
 Lengths: 1751
 Similarities: 1681/1751
 Gaps: 20/1751
 Scores: 8205.0

 06 vs 07:
 Lengths: 1776
 Similarities: 1731/1776
 Gaps: 25/1776
 Scores: 9703.0
