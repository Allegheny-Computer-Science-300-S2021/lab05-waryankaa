#### Part 1.


 1. Which software did you use to conduct your analysis?

 In order to conduct my analysis, I used the the online interactive demo provided in the lab.

 2. How similar were the two sequences (`s1.fasta` and `s2.fasta`) which you applied an alignment program?

 After applying the alignment program, the two sequences are very similar. Of the 20 nucleotides given 12 were the same across both sequences.


 3. Are the two sequences closely related to each other, in your opinion?

 In my opinion, the two sequences were closely related.


 4. What proof do you have to suggest such a claim?

I'd suggest that the two sequences were closely related because over half of the nucleotides are the same. If they were not similar, then they would have more different sequences. While they are not the same, they most likely had a close common ancestor.

```
A	T	T	T	G	G	C	T	A	C	A	T	T	T	C	A	C	A	G	T	-
A	T	T	T	C	A	C	A	G	T	A	T	T	-	C	A	C	T	G	A	G
Score = 1
```

#### Part 2
 1. How much similarity exists between each of the sequences to the others?

#TODO


 2. Based on your results so far (which are too few to provide a comprehensive study), do you believe there is evidence that human adaptation is occurring in H5N1 viruses that might merit concern about human-to-human transmission in the near future?

 3. Statistics: What were the numbers of Lengths, Similarities, Gaps and Scores for each of your alignment tasks?
